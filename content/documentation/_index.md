Deckhouse Development Platform (DDP) is a comprehensive solution for managing all stages of development through a single interface.

The platform helps IT professionals work more efficiently — it automates operations related to the service lifecycle and provides tools to assess the overall system performance.

## Key features

- **Unified development standards for teams**.
  The platform enables the creation of templates and standard configurations (CI/CD, Kubernetes, etc.) and ensures these standards are propagated across all development teams.
- **Dynamic environments under control**.
  Creating, updating, and deleting environments takes just minutes, with stand setup and removal performed automatically.
- **Integration of otherwise incompatible services**.
  Interaction can be configured with any infrastructure system that has an API (such as ticket management systems, firewall access management, etc.).
- **Simplified onboarding of developers and teams**.
  New team members can start contributing quickly thanks to templates, documentation, and preconfigured project structures provided by the platform.
- **Digitization of development processes and scenarios**.
  A BPMN-like process description engine helps automate and optimize all stages of development.
- **Built-in CMDB**.
  DDP automatically gathers data from infrastructure services, compiles it into a service catalog, and visualizes the dependencies between them.
- **Service parameter monitoring**.
  The solution quickly verifies key service performance indicators using health checks and collects static analysis metrics, vulnerability data, CI/CD pipeline statuses, and more.
