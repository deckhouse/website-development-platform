## Backward-incompatible changes

### Icons

Icons are now selected from a centralized catalog (built-in library icons or user-uploaded icons). If you previously used icons specified via a URL, they will no longer be displayed.

### Database requirements

Global search requires the PostgreSQL `pg_trgm` extension. When upgrading to v1.2.0, install the extension in the database you use:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
```

## New features

### AI agent

Added a secure storage mechanism for AI provider credentials.

### Global search

Added global search across all platform entities:

- **Quick access** — search is available from the top bar on all platform pages.
- **Fuzzy search** — search works by entity name, ID, and team, tolerating typos.
- **Access control aware** — results include only entities the user has permission to access.
- **Pagination** — results are paginated for easier navigation.
- **Fast navigation** — clicking a result opens the corresponding entity page.

### Actions

- Added the `actions.logging.enabled` setting to control action logs output to stdout.
- Added the ability to configure a temporary response for actions.

### Object ownership

Added automatic assignment of the current user as the owner of newly created objects.

### RBAC model

- Added new global permissions for managing icons: `create:icons` and `delete:icons`.
- Added the `Developer` global role preset.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed forced regeneration of an object ID when opening the edit form.
- Fixed RBAC rules for editing team variables.
- Fixed the behavior of the `datasources.logging.enabled` setting.
- Fixed a hang when creating a Vault secret without the `allow_update` parameter.
- Fixed the approve/skip mechanisms for actions in processes.
- Fixed external service selection for actions in processes.
